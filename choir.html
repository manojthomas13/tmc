                Manchester Marthoma Prayer fellowship had a choir since it's been started in 2003. But activities were
                limited to certain extent like Christmas carol service and special worship services. The prayer
                fellowship was transformed to Tabore Marthoma Church in 2007 and we have decided to re-structure the
                choir in a more disciplined and organised way to explore the maximum prospectus. We have almost
                succeeded in attracting new members especially talented youngsters to the choir and arranging regular
                choir practices. The official Tabore Marthoma Church choir was formed in 2008 and during Holy Communion
                service on 19th October 2008 it was dedicated to church by Rev. Shibi Abraham.
              </p>

                Choir has become an integral part of our worship service as we actively participate in both Malayalam
                and English worship services. Our aim is to perform one new Maramon Convention song along with Christian
                Hymns on every worship service. We are also actively participating in joint worship and choir singing
                with Church of England Choir. We have come to an agreement with Church of England Choir to sing
                Malayalam Psalms in future.
              </p>

              <p>
                We have organised Christmas Carol service in 2008 and also participated in carol singing competitions.
                Tabore Marthoma Church Choir is available for Wedding Ceremonies, Baptism, House warming and special
                occasions of Church members on special request (subjected to availability of choir members and time of
                event). We encourage young talents to perform musical instruments in church activities.

                As a church we are in our childhood stage, we are unable to highlight many major achievements but 2008
                Christmas Carole service was a grand success with its outlook, selection of songs, presentation and
                organisation. It was a different magical experience for the church members.We are affiliated to
                Department of Sacred Music and Communications which is an official Musical and Communication wing of
                Marthoma Churches all over the globe.
              </p>

              <p>
                We welcome all church members who have got interest and dedication in music and church choir activities
                to secure a place in Tabore Marthoma Church Choir, especially youngsters. A minimum of fifty percentage
                attendance in practice session is mandatory for all choir members. We also welcome anyone who is willing
                to play musical instruments for our choir.
